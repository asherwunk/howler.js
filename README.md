# THIS IS A FORK

This is my own personal fork of the amazing howler library: https://howlerjs.com. I have modified it slightly for use in my own asherwunk/pygjs (PyGame in NodeWebkit/Browser).  I forked it so that I can perform a commit showing all my customizations (there are few)

This library is integrated into asherwunk/gamejs

# What's Different

I have enabled sources to also be buffer arrays, and the ability to extract the buffer array of a sound (it's stored as a property on self)

I also have added a few functions to the global howler, including pause, play, fade etc.
